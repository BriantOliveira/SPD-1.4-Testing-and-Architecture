## Why You Should Know This (2 min)

> The most important single aspect of software development is to be clear about what you are trying to build. - **Bjarne Stroustrup**

## Learning Objectives (3 min)

1. Formally define the word _pseudocode_ and recognize it's role in solving  engineering problems.
1. Identify and describe pseudocode's role in the _Software Development Life Cycle_.
1. Implement proper _pseudocode_ that solves real-world problems.

## Initial Exercise (15 min)

TBD

## Overview/TT I (20 min)

1. Use the [mind map](Resources/2-PseudocodeForPros.pdf) to summarize the steps in building classes and routines (another word for _functions_). Additionally, go over the PPP strategy outlined in the map.
Overview of collaborative development practices
Pair programming
Other kinds of development practices (XP, etc)

## In Class Activity I

### Create / Construct / Review (30 min)

Steps for Creating a Class (page 216)
Steps for Creating a Routine (page 217)

## Assignment (Due Next Class)

### Important Prep for Lab (15 min)
